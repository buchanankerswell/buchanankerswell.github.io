## Geoscientist

I study how Earth's mantle and tectonic plates move using fieldwork, petrography, numerical geodynamic modeling, applied statistics, and analytical techniques in laboratories. My work focuses on rock formation and deformation at a small scales, and how these processes affect larger systems. Thus, my colleagues and students typically work in remote mountains, use electron beams in labs, and run simulations on large computer clusters. I also teach, create learning materials, and explore how AI can improve geoscience.

## Scholarly Teaching

I focus on evidence-based teaching in higher education, which helps me grow professionally. Learn more about my [teaching philosophy]({{ "/teaching/#teaching-philosophy" | relative_url }}) and review my [teaching record]({{ "/teaching/#teaching-record" | relative_url }}). My [CV]({{ "cv/#curriculum-vitae" | relative_url }}) lists the courses I have taught.

## Cycling Enthusiast

I love cycling. When I’m not working, I train, race, visit coffee shops, or plan my next adventure. [Follow me on strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/11468816).
