## Geoscientist

**I am a metamorphic petrologist** interested in understanding the dynamics of Earth's mantle and implications of converging tectonic plates. My work involves analyzing rocks and quantifying the impacts of petrological processes on geodynamics. I approach problems **with a broad skillset**, including: field work, petrography, computational fluid dynamics, machine learning and applied statistics, thermodynamic modeling, and analytical techniques (e.g., EPMA, LAICPMS, Raman microscopy). Thus, my students might visit remote mountains, tune electron-beams in laboratories, execute scripts on high-performance computing systems, and engage in scientific communication and education. I also have special interests in scholarly teaching, developing cutting-edge learning materials, and applying artificial intelligence to advance the Geosciences.

## Scholarly teaching

Scholarly teaching is an evidence-based approach to teaching and learning in higher education---and a core focus of my professional development. Read about my [teaching interests]({{ "teaching.html" | relative_url }}) and review the [evidence of teaching effectiveness]({{ "teaching-evidence.html" | relative_url }}) that I have been documenting since 2020. See my [CV]({{ "cv.html" | relative_url }}) for a complete list of courses that I have taught.

## Cycling enthusiast

I have a deep passion for cycling. When I'm not working, I'm usually training, racing, wheeling around coffee shops, or planning my next adventure. [Follow me on strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/11468816).
