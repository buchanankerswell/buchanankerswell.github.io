## Geoscientist

I am passionate about research and teaching Geoscience at many levels. I enjoy engaging with curious nonexperts in my community about the local geology, for example, as much as I enjoy instructing undergraduates or presenting new research done by myself and others. I will always jump at opportunities to observe wild rocks in the field, yet I spend most days writing code, manuscripts, proposals, and/or trying to be useful to my students and colleagues.

## Scholarly teaching

Scholarly teaching is an evidence-based approach to teaching and learning in higher education---and a core focus of my professional development. Read about my [teaching interests]({{ "teaching.html" | relative_url }}) and review the [evidence of teaching effectiveness]({{ "teaching-evidence.html" | relative_url }}) that I have been documenting since 2020. See my [CV]({{ "cv.html" | relative_url }}) for a complete list of courses that I have taught.

## Cycling enthusiast

I have a deep passion for cycling. When I'm not working, I'm usually training, racing, wheeling around coffee shops, or planning my next adventure. I am also willing to guide tours. [Follow me on strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/11468816).
