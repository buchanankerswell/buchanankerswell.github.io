A lab exercise focusing on the nuances of analyzing data from open-source geochemical repositories. I use this handout in my petrology courses. To be submitted to the “The On the Cutting Edge: [Exemplary Reviewed Activity Collection](https://serc.carleton.edu/teachearth/exemplary.html)” maintained by the NAGT.

I wrote the handout using [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and [paged.js](https://pagedjs.org). If you like the style of this handout, you can find a template [here](https://github.com/buchanankerswell/paged_handout) with some [examples](https://github.com/buchanankerswell/paged_handout/tree/main/examples).
