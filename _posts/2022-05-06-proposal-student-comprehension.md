This project is based on the work by ([Jones, 2020](https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/bitstream/handle/1840.20/37510/etd.pdf?sequence=1)), who developed a web-based tool for assessing student learning in intro Geoscience courses: *Confidence-based Learning Accuracy Support System* (CLASS). CLASS takes input from students during examinations on their perceived confidence levels. The proposed work extends this system (or similar system) to reading comprehension and compliance by collecting large volumes of student responses during assigned readings. Questions may include: perceived level of comprehension, perceived level of relevance, time to completion, number of rereads, and more. Large volumes of responses allows questions about student learning to be evaluated quantitatively, providing rapid feedback to instructors. This work would require support from collaborators with expertise in pedagogy to help direct the development of the system.
