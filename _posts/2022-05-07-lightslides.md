A [website](https://buchanankerswell.com/light_slides/) showcasing random assortments of thin sections from Matt Kohn's *[library](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dDgAwuMuPTXCj0MPO_G6jTz4pzXVcZi).* Useful for petrology courses---especially for remote teaching and learning.

### Example from the Voltri Massif, Italy

Garnet porphyroblasts (reddish blocky crystals) hosted in a matrix of minty-green sodium-rich clinopyroxene (omphacite) that are partially retrogressed to blueish sodium-rich amphibole (glaucophane) in areas. Note the cluster of dark champagne colored rutile crystals near the border. Collected during and [EFIRE](http://www.geoprisms.org/exterra/e-fire/) excursion to Italy in 2017.
