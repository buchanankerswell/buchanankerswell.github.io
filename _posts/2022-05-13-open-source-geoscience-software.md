Important skills for any geoscientist to master include finding, **understanding**, and applying software tools to geoscience problems. Examples of day-to-day tasks that require great computational skills from Geoscientists include:

> ## Critical computational skills for Geoscientists:
> 1. reducing raw instrument signals into useable data
> 2. writing, sharing, and maintaining high-quality code (libraries) for community research
> 3. gathering data from (or contributing data to) community repositories
> 4. visualizing and communicating data with compelling graphics
> 5. cleaning, structuring, and maintaining high-quality data assets for future use

Individuals and groups developing code for geoscience applications enable research in my own lab. As such, I feel compelled to promote their work. Below are my top picks[^1] for software packages every geoscience graduate student should know and love.
