A [web app](https://kerswell.shinyapps.io/xtal-sttl) for calculating silicate melt density, viscosity, and the settling velocity of spherical crystals. Well-suited for an igneous petrology course. For example, see this [lab exercise](https://github.com/buchanankerswell/xtal-sttl/blob/main/exercise.pdf).
