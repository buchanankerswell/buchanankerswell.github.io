This field-based study examined the exhumation history of the Tso Morari nappe in NW India through detailed structural, microtextural, and thermochronological analyses. The [manuscript](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020TC006482) was published in *Tectonics* on November 25, 2020.

***Figure:*** *Cross sections of our three mapped transects. Areas that exhibit similar apparent dip of tectonic foliation were divided into dip domains, which are separated by kink axes that bisect the interlimb angle (e.g., Suppe, 1983).*
