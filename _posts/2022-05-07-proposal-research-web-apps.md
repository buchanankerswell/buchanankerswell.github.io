Web-hosted applications have potential to improve workflows of labs by replacing proprietary software that handle specific tasks like data reduction, visualization, and statistical analysis. Many simple research tasks do not require large software packages with inaccessible documentation and expensive licensing (you know the clunky software, loaded on *that one computer* in a cold, noisy lab). Most importantly, open-source, web-based apps increase accessability for students, and seamlessly transfer research practices into classrooms. [Here](https://github.com/buchanankerswell/xtal-sttl) is an example of an app for calculating the Stokes settling velocity of crystals in magmas. The app is accompanied by a classroom exercise designed for Igneous Petrology courses.
