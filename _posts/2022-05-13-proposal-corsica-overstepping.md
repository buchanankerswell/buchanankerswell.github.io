Development of elastic barometric techniques recently triggered reinvestigation of metamorphic reaction kinetics and potential overstepping of mineral stability fields during tectonic processing at convergent margins ([Castro et al., 2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00206814.2016.1200499); [Spear and Pattison, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254117301250?casa_token=DGNNlObHVPgAAAAA:KAjlV9ivQVnhaqEK9NQm1LV51C3ON5PBCrV8UJn-LJNyWEux-mpQmDafuIJb5SbI56c8pv3dAA); [Spear & Wolfe, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254119304309?casa_token=CmRJ963DOUEAAAAA:wM1GyDhr_J8ssCrC6c_V6aucs4RSuh2KZN07IRYOIAb8g9tfGCFSzbL039hebor6fpCwtliyNg)). Garnet forming and consuming reactions have important implications for subduction zone dynamics ([Hacker et al., 2003](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2001jb001127); [Dragovic et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0009254112001829)), so the rates, PT conditions, and (dis)continuity of these reactions are critically important to understand. The extent to which equilibria reactions are overstepped during subduction is not well understood because evidence for significant overstepping in subduction zones is currently limited to few examples (e.g. [Castro et al., 2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00206814.2016.1200499)). This work proposes replicating estimates of reaction overstepping using rocks from two exhumed ophiolites in the W. Alpsâ€”[Monviso](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Monte+Viso/@44.6673101,7.0728712,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x12ccd7d5494c6e91:0xff0ecf06a5e872ba!8m2!3d44.667312!4d7.0903808!5m1!1e4) and [Corsica](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Corsica,+France/@41.1603041,7.0749677,7.23z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x12d72403b09b0971:0xa88522ec71a1cb8d!8m2!3d42.0396042!4d9.0128926!5m1!1e4). The results will provide more evidence to support or contradict the hypothesis that significant reaction overstepping occurs in subduction zones.
