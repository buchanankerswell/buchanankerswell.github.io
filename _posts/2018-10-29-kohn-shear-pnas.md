excerpt: Adding shear heating to thermal models simultaneously reproduces surface heat flow and the P–T conditions of exhumed metamorphic rocks.
---

Thermal structure influences many aspects of subduction zone metamorphism, rheology, and melting. Most thermal models assume small or negligible friction coefficients and underpredict the pressure–temperature (P–T) conditions recorded by subduction zone metamorphic rocks by hundreds of degrees Celsius. Incorporating shear heating into these models allows for simultaneous reproduction of surface heat flow and the P–T conditions of exhumed metamorphic rocks. Because hot, dry rocks possess greater density than cold, wet ones, young-hot subduction systems produce rocks with lower buoyancy and greater difficulty of exhumation. Consequently, the metamorphic record may underrepresent young-hot subduction while overrepresenting old-cold subduction.

***Figure:*** *Normalized heat flow data vs. normalized distance. Model curves are labeled with assumed apparent coefficients of friction (µ$^\*$). Large dots with error bars are medians of binned data and their errors. Gray regions are affected by corner flow and are not considered in this study. (A) Raw data excluding Cascadia. (B) Raw data for Cascadia. (C) All data between normalized distances of 0.02 and 1.0 for well-sampled subduction zones, randomly sampled in proportion to trench length.*
