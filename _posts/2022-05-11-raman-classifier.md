Training convolutional neural networks on the [RRUFF](https://rruff.info) database to identify minerals from Raman spectra. Excellent project for a student interested in spectral datasets, data science, machine learning, and implementing rapid classification & identification of geologic materials. Message me for opportunities to expand this work.

This work aims to build software tools for metamorphic petrologists applying elastic thermobarometric techniques for determining PT conditions of metamorphism.
