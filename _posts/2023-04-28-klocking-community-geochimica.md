This work emerged from a collaborative effort during a pre-conference workshop held at the Goldschmidt meeting in Honolulu, HI, on 8–9 July 2022. Our objective included developing recommendations that would enhance the infrastructure for storing and sharing geochemical data. In collaboration with the broader geochemical community, we launched OneGeochemistry—a community-driven initiative aimed at coordinating the development of a global, online network of machine-readable, persistent, interoperable, and reusable geochemical data.

*Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta* published the [manuscript](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703723001916) on April 28, 2023. You can find the article [here]({{ "assets/pdf/klocking-23-community-geochimica.pdf" | relative_url }}).

Each group of stakeholders has different needs and motives for contributing to or enforcing FAIR data practices.
