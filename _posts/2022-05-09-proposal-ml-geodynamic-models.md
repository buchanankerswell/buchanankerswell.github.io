The application of computational fluid dynamics to geologic systems (e.g. [Gerya & Yuen, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031920103001900?casa_token=0qnFE29TxugAAAAA:07b2EEUPQXsZ8iYBLHyuNTehVTqlwV8TUmrK7yY_FDXN0YNr2ERSi2eJwoDmq_wfTcYGxmlzwQ)) has improved Geoscientists' intuitions about the geodynamics of active planets. For example, why is subduction one-sided on Earth [(Gerya et al., 2008)](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/36/1/43/129999/Why-is-terrestrial-subduction-one-sided?casa_token=JyN00vn0jm4AAAAA:2BlbhAPsmFkvmFjNUQdiZfPEgLdfBTHFguXJS3G385GKG9_S6bkaA-P1K5UM0KZIeUfPtKC-) and what forms Corona Structures on Venus ([GÃ¼lcher et al., 2020](https://idp.nature.com/authorize/casa?redirect_uri=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-020-0606-1&casa_token=qvNzrnVvrPEAAAAA:t70sKKRTLS76bta5V-9yG1q2I-OVYBKH1SDipBYRUAihGNATNu_Arkmu5aDr6-UIFVsNM_7bzN2IRXw5))? Gaining even deeper intuition by tracing millions of rock parcels (markers) as models evolve is a key advantage of this technique. Much like tracking simulated air parcels moving around air foils is useful to the aerodynamicist, the flow paths, pressure-temperature-time paths, and stress-strain history of markers reveal (un)expected tectonic processes. Recognizing specific tectonic processes from millions of unlabelled markers is nontrivial, however, but is possible by combining feature engineering and widely-used classification algorightms (e.g. [Kerswell et al., 2023; in prep]({{ "assets/dissertation/dissertation-ebook.html#chpt4" | relative_url }})). These methods can work with any models using Lagrangian reference frames, so the proposed work is virtually unlimited. Currently my work focuses on subduction processes, but this work could involve researchers working in the cryosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, or non-geoscience fields that use computational fluid dynamics (i.e. engineering applications).
