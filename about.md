## Geoscientist

**I am a metamorphic petrologist and geodynamicist** interested in understanding the dynamics of Earth's mantle and the consequences of converging tectonic plates. My work involves analyzing rocks on the micro-scale to understand where and how they formed, and then asking what are the impacts of those micro-scale processes on macro-scale geodynamics. I approach problems **with a broad skillset**, including: field work, petrography, analytical techniques (e.g., EPMA, LAICPMS, Raman microscopy), thermodynamics, computational fluid dynamics, and machine learning. Thus, my students might visit remote mountains, tune electron-beams in laboratories, run simulaions on high-performance computing systems, and engage in scientific communication and education. I also have special interests in scholarly teaching, developing cutting-edge learning materials, and applying artificial intelligence to advance the Geosciences.

## Scholarly Teaching

Scholarly teaching is an evidence-based approach to teaching and learning in higher education---and a core focus of my professional development. Read about my [teaching interests]({{ "assets/html/teaching.html" | relative_url }}) and review the [evidence of teaching effectiveness]({{ "assets/html/teaching-evidence.html" | relative_url }}) that I have been documenting since 2020. See my [CV]({{ "cv.html" | relative_url }}) for a complete list of courses that I have taught.

## Cycling Enthusiast

I have a deep passion for cycling. When I'm not working, I'm usually training, racing, wheeling around coffee shops, or planning my next adventure. [Follow me on strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/11468816).
